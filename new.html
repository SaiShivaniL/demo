    <h1>What I learnt about html!!!</h1>
    <p>HTML is hyper text markup language. <br>It is a language used for creating web pages.It describes the structure of a web page.It can be done in any editor even in notepad but should add a .html tag while saving the page.It can be viewed through a browser.<br>I feel it is easier to learn html if we know some of the basics.</p>
